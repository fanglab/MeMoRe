* Q1: Are my uploaded datasets secured?
     The totality of the datasets processing is done remotely on `shinyapps.io <https://www.shinyapps.io/>`_ servers and our source code can be consulted from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/fanglab/MeMoRe/>`_. Other users and ourselves do not have access to any of the uploaded data. More information about shinyapps.io security and compliance can be found `here <https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/security-and-compliance.html>`_.
